This is the basic code I use on the server for updating http://twitter.com/cdarwin and the 
corresponding Facebook page (which you can LIKE if you wish at http://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/The-Beagle-Voyage/143831765103)

i use a local client app, written on C#, for managing things locally, and XML-RPC to sync to the server database. I'll be posting that code too, shortly.
